#MyToken
This Solidity program is a simple "MyToken" smart contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of creating, minting, and burning tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how token contracts work.

#Description
This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract defines a token with a name, abbreviation, and total supply. It includes functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens. This program serves as a practical introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a foundation for more complex token projects in the future.

#Requirements
The contract has public variables to store details about the token (Token Name, Token Abbreviation, Total Supply).
The contract includes a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint).
A mint function takes an address and a value, increasing the total supply and the balance of the specified address.
A burn function takes an address and a value, decreasing the total supply and the balance of the specified address, with conditions to ensure sufficient balance.

#Getting Started
Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). 

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn functions. For example, to mint tokens, provide an address and a value to the mint function. Similarly, to burn tokens, provide an address and a value to the burn function. Ensure that the balance is sufficient when burning tokens.
